This is a project created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) , which is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

After cloning and downloading the required dependencies, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) with your browser to see the result. (use qrCodeId 12345 for testing, but remember to remove dev.db from your commits!)

Everything for this web app should be included within the /src file. 

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Before making a pull request, a quick check for bugs will be very appreciated. 

When creating new files, using .ts and .tsx is recommended, although .js is also acceptable.
